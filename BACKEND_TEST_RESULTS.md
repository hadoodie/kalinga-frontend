## 🚀 How to Use in Frontend

### 1. Start Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
php artisan serve
```

Server runs on: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### 2. Start Frontend Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Use Services in Components

```jsx
import resourceService from "./services/resourceService";
import hospitalService from "./services/hospitalService";

// Get all resources
const resources = await resourceService.getAll();

// Get all hospitals
const hospitals = await hospitalService.getAll();

// Filter resources
const foodItems = await resourceService.getByCategory("food");

// Search
const results = await resourceService.search("Rice");
```

### 4. Test Component

```jsx
import ResourceTest from "./components/logistics/ResourceTest";

function App() {
  return <ResourceTest />;
}
```

## 📝 Notes

1. **No unit_cost field** - As requested, the migration and seeder have been updated to remove unit_cost
2. **Test endpoints** - Created `/api/test/*` endpoints for easy testing without authentication
3. **Protected endpoints** - Full CRUD operations available with authentication
4. **Hospital relationships** - Resources are properly linked to hospitals via `hospital_id`
5. **Status auto-calculation** - Resource status is automatically calculated based on quantity vs minimum_stock

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Backend is ready** - All migrations, seeders, and API endpoints working
2. ✅ **Frontend services created** - Ready to use in your React components
3. ⏳ **Integrate into logistics pages** - Use services in your dashboard components
4. ⏳ **Add authentication** - Switch from test endpoints to protected endpoints
5. ⏳ **Add image upload** - Implement resource image upload (optional)
6. ⏳ **Add real-time updates** - Consider WebSockets for live updates (optional)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend server not running?

```bash
cd backend
php artisan serve
```

### Frontend can't connect?

- Check backend URL in `src/services/api.js` (should be `http://localhost:8000/api`)
- Make sure CORS is configured in backend `.env`

### Database errors?

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
