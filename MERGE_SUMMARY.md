# Merge Summary: upstream/main into feature/auth

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Branch:** feature/auth  
**Merge Commit:** 0fbbefd

## Overview

Successfully merged upstream/main into feature/auth branch, resolving all conflicts and integrating the folder reorganization with the authentication system.

## Conflicts Resolved

### 1. **src/App.jsx** ✅
- **Issue:** Both branches modified routing structure
- **Resolution:** 
  - Kept authentication with `AuthProvider` and `ProtectedRoute` components
  - Updated all import paths to match new folder structure (pages-account, pages-resident, pages-logistics, pages-patients, pages-admin, pages-responders)
  - Added new patient routes from upstream
  - Changed logistics dashboard route from `/logistic-dashboard` to `/logistics-dashboard`
  - Added `/logistics-settings` route

### 2. **src/components/login/LogIn.jsx** ✅
- **Issue:** Authentication logic vs hardcoded navigation
- **Resolution:** Kept feature/auth version with proper role-based routing through `navigateToRoleBasedRoute()`
- **Why:** Upstream had `navigate("/dashboard")` which doesn't respect user roles

### 3. **src/components/logis-dashboard/ResourceMngmt.jsx** ✅
- **Issue:** File was deleted by upstream (folder reorganization) but modified in feature/auth (backend integration)
- **Resolution:** 
  - Moved your integrated version from `src/components/logis-dashboard/ResourceMngmt.jsx` to `src/components/logistics/ResourceMngmt.jsx`
  - Preserved all backend integration work (API calls, loading states, error handling, fetchResources function)

### 4. **src/components/logistics/LogiSide.jsx** ✅
- **Issue:** Dashboard path mismatch
- **Resolution:** Changed from `/logistic-dashboard` to `/logistics-dashboard` to match App.jsx routing

### 5. **src/components/patients/Sidebar.jsx** ✅
- **Issue:** Different menu items for patient sidebar
- **Resolution:** Used upstream version with proper patient routes:
  - `/patient-dashboard` instead of `/dashboard`
  - `/patient-appointments` for Appointments & Scheduling
  - `/patient-health-records` for Health Records
  - `/patient-messages` for Messages & Contact

### 6. **src/components/verify-accs/FillInfo.jsx** ✅
- **Issue:** Missing `submitting` state in upstream
- **Resolution:** Kept feature/auth version with `submitting` state for proper form submission handling

## File Structure Changes

### Folders Reorganized
- `src/pages/` → Split into:
  - `src/pages-account/` (login, create account, verify ID, etc.)
  - `src/pages-resident/` (dashboard, emergency, weather, etc.)
  - `src/pages-logistics/` (logistics management)
  - `src/pages-patients/` (patient portal)
  - `src/pages-admin/` (admin portal)
  - `src/pages-responders/` (responder portal)
  - `src/pages-home/` (landing page)

- `src/components/logis-dashboard/` → `src/components/logistics/`

### New Files Added (from upstream)
- **Admin Components:**
  - `src/components/admin/AdminLayout.jsx`
  - `src/components/admin/SectionHeader.jsx`
  - `src/components/admin/StatCard.jsx`
  - `src/components/admin/sections/` (8 section components)

- **Patient Components:**
  - `src/components/patients/Appointment.jsx`
  - `src/components/patients/Dashboard.jsx`
  - `src/components/patients/HealthRecords.jsx`
  - `src/components/patients/Messages.jsx`
  - `src/components/patients/Settings.jsx`

- **Responder Components:**
  - `src/components/responder/ResponderLayout.jsx`
  - `src/components/responder/context/ResponderDataContext.jsx`
  - `src/components/responder/sections/` (10 section components)

- **Utilities:**
  - `src/lib/datetime.js`
  - `src/lib/weather.js`
